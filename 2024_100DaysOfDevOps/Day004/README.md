## Learning Plan (1-2 Hours)

### Advanced Script Structuring
1. **Script Organization and Best Practices** (15 minutes)
    - Learn best practices for organizing and structuring scripts.
    - **Notes:**
        - 

### Functions and Modular Scripting
2. **Writing and Using Functions in Scripts** (20 minutes)
    - Define and call functions within a script.
        ```sh
        my_function() {
            echo "This is a function"
        }
        my_function
        ```
    - **Notes:**
        - 

### Handling Command-Line Arguments
3. **Processing Arguments in Scripts** (20 minutes)
    - Use `$1`, `$2`, etc., to access command-line arguments.
        ```sh
        echo "First argument: $1"
        echo "Second argument: $2"
        ```
    - Use `getopts` for more complex argument parsing.
        ```sh
        while getopts "a:b:" opt; do
          case $opt in
            a) echo "Option A: $OPTARG";;
            b) echo "Option B: $OPTARG";;
            \?) echo "Invalid option";;
          esac
        done
        ```
    - **Notes:**
        - 

### Input/Output Redirection and Piping
4. **Advanced I/O Redirection and Piping** (20 minutes)
    - Use redirection operators and pipes to manage input and output.
        ```sh
        command > output.txt
        command >> output.txt
        command < input.txt
        command1 | command2
        ```
    - **Notes:**
        - 

### Error Handling and Debugging
5. **Implementing Error Handling** (15 minutes)
    - Use `set -e`, `set -u`, and `set -o pipefail` for robust error handling.
        ```sh
        set -e
        set -u
        set -o pipefail
        ```
    - Trap errors and handle them gracefully.
        ```sh
        trap 'echo "An error occurred"; exit 1' ERR
        ```
    - **Notes:**
        - 

### Script Optimization Techniques
6. **Optimizing Shell Scripts** (20 minutes)
    - Identify and eliminate unnecessary commands.
    - Use built-in commands and avoid external processes where possible.
    - Profile script performance with `time` and `strace`.
        ```sh
        time ./myscript.sh
        strace -c ./myscript.sh
        ```
    - **Notes:**
        - 

## Hands-On Exercises (1 Hour)

### Exercise 1: Modular Script with Functions (20 minutes)
- Write a script that uses functions to perform multiple tasks.
- **Notes:**
    - 

### Exercise 2: Command-Line Argument Handling (20 minutes)
- Write a script that processes command-line arguments and performs actions based on them.
- **Notes:**
    - 

### Exercise 3: Error Handling and Optimization (20 minutes)
- Write a script that includes robust error handling and optimize its performance.
- **Notes:**
    - 

### Evening Review
7. **Review and Reflect** (10 minutes)
    - Summarize what you've learned about advanced shell scripting techniques.
    - Reflect on any challenges faced during hands-on exercises and how to overcome them.
    - Plan for the next dayâ€™s topic: Kubernetes (K8s) Introduction and Architecture.
    - **Notes:**
