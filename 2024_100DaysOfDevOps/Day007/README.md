- Deploy services and applications on Docker Swarm.

## Topics Covered
1. Docker Swarm Overview
2. Setting Up a Docker Swarm Cluster
3. Docker Swarm Nodes and Services
4. Basic Docker Swarm Commands

## Learning Plan (1-2 Hours)

### Docker Swarm Overview
1. **Introduction to Docker Swarm** (15 minutes)
    - Understand what Docker Swarm is and its benefits for orchestration.
    - **Notes:**
        - 

### Setting Up a Docker Swarm Cluster
2. **Initialize a Swarm** (20 minutes)
    - Initialize a Docker Swarm on a manager node.
        ```sh
        docker swarm init
        ```
    - Add worker nodes to the Swarm.
        ```sh
        docker swarm join --token <token> <manager-ip>:2377
        ```
    - **Notes:**
        - 

### Docker Swarm Nodes and Services
3. **Managing Nodes and Services** (20 minutes)
    - List and inspect Swarm nodes.
        ```sh
        docker node ls
        docker node inspect <node-id>
        ```
    - Create and manage services.
        ```sh
        docker service create --name my-service -p 80:80 nginx
        docker service ls
        docker service ps my-service
        ```
    - **Notes:**
        - 

### Basic Docker Swarm Commands
4. **Using Docker Swarm Commands** (15 minutes)
    - Learn essential commands to manage Docker Swarm clusters and services.
        ```sh
        docker swarm update
        docker service scale my-service=3
        docker service update --image nginx:latest my-service
        docker service rm my-service
        ```
    - **Notes:**
        - 

## Hands-On Exercises (1 Hour)

### Exercise 1: Initialize a Docker Swarm (20 minutes)
- Set up a Docker Swarm cluster with one manager node and at least one worker node.
- **Notes:**
    - 

### Exercise 2: Deploy and Manage Services (20 minutes)
- Create and manage a service on Docker Swarm.
- **Notes:**
    - 

### Exercise 3: Scale and Update Services (20 minutes)
- Scale and update a service within the Docker Swarm cluster.
- **Notes:**
    - 

### Evening Review
5. **Review and Reflect** (10 minutes)
    - Summarize what you've learned about Docker Swarm and basic orchestration.
    - Reflect on any challenges faced during hands-on exercises and how to overcome them.
    - Plan for the next dayâ€™s topic: Advanced Docker Swarm Features and Orchestration.
